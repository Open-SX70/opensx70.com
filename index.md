# Polaroid SX70 Information
{:.f4.fw6.f1-ns.lh-title.measure.mt0}
Information and specs on the beautiful Polaroid SX-70 / 680 cameras.

## What is this?
First let me explain - Iâ€™m in love with these beautiful cameras. But they are getting older and information on them is hard to find and is disappearing from the internet. *So* I thought I would try and down all my findings on this beautiful camera and its select variants. By having this documentation open source, people can update it with any information that they may find or have.

I'm also going to have a section on modifications. One of my goals is to be able to modify these beautiful cameras in a manner of ways. The First of which will be allowing the SX70 to shoot 600 film speed.

*I will be adding current information on the stock cameras* This will allow me to then look at modifications. And hopefully document my findings.
